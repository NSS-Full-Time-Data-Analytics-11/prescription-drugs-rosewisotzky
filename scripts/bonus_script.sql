-- 1. How many npi numbers appear in the prescriber table but not in the prescription table?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT npi)
FROM prescriber
	EXCEPT
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT npi)
FROM prescription;

-- 2.
--     a. Find the top five drugs (generic_name) prescribed by prescribers with the specialty of Family Practice.
SELECT 
	generic_name, 
	SUM(total_claim_count)
FROM drug
	INNER JOIN prescription USING(drug_name)
	INNER JOIN prescriber ON prescription.npi = prescriber.npi
WHERE specialty_description = 'Family Practice'
GROUP BY generic_name
ORDER BY sum DESC
LIMIT 5;

--     b. Find the top five drugs (generic_name) prescribed by prescribers with the specialty of Cardiology.

SELECT 
	generic_name, 
	SUM(total_claim_count)
FROM drug
	INNER JOIN prescription USING(drug_name)
	INNER JOIN prescriber ON prescription.npi = prescriber.npi
WHERE specialty_description = 'Cardiology'
GROUP BY generic_name
ORDER BY sum DESC
LIMIT 5;

--     c. Which drugs are in the top five prescribed by Family Practice prescribers and Cardiologists? Combine what you did for parts a and b into a single query to answer this question.

SELECT 
	generic_name, 
	SUM(total_claim_count)
FROM drug
	INNER JOIN prescription USING(drug_name)
	INNER JOIN prescriber ON prescription.npi = prescriber.npi
WHERE specialty_description = 'Family Practice'
GROUP BY generic_name
	UNION
SELECT 
	generic_name, 
	SUM(total_claim_count)
FROM drug
	INNER JOIN prescription USING(drug_name)
	INNER JOIN prescriber ON prescription.npi = prescriber.npi
WHERE specialty_description = 'Cardiology'
GROUP BY generic_name
ORDER BY sum DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 3. Your goal in this question is to generate a list of the top prescribers in each of the major metropolitan areas of Tennessee.

--     a. First, write a query that finds the top 5 prescribers in Nashville in terms of the total number of claims (total_claim_count) across all drugs. Report the npi, the total number of claims, and include a column showing the city.

    
--     b. Now, report the same for Memphis.
    
--     c. Combine your results from a and b, along with the results for Knoxville and Chattanooga.

-- 4. Find all counties which had an above-average number of overdose deaths. Report the county name and number of overdose deaths.

-- 5.
--     a. Write a query that finds the total population of Tennessee.
    
--     b. Build off of the query that you wrote in part a to write a query that returns for each county that county's name, its population, and the percentage of the total population of Tennessee that is contained in that county.
